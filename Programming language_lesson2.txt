Programming language: sets of words and symbols to write a program 

Two types
1. High level language: It is language that is understandable by humans. every high level language has a specific syntax (collection of rules). example: C++, java, Python, Ruby etc 
2. Low level language: It's closer to computers and far away from humans. Computers can easily understand them but it is difficult for humans to understand.
 It is further divided into Machine language and  Assembly language
Machine Language: It is a low level language that has instructions written in it in binary form such as 0's and 1's. It is a fundamental language of computers.

Assembly language: It is a type of low level language that uses mnemonics (human-readable symbols) instead of binary.
For example: MOV, ADD, SUB 

Flow: High level -> Assembly (assembler) -> Machine language
